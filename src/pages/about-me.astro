    <h1>About Andrea Tosato</h1>
    
    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        Andrea Tosato is a Professor of Law at the SMU Dedman School of Law, where his research focuses on the intersection between private law, emerging technologies, and intangible assets. Professor Tosato is internationally recognized for his scholarship on commercial law, secured transactions, and bankruptcy law as they intersect with cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs, and verified carbon credits.
      </p>

      <h2>UCC Article 12 and the Law of Digital Assets</h2>

      <p>
        Andrea Tosato was a key contributor to the ULC/ALI Uniform Commercial Code and Emerging Technologies Committee that drafted the <strong>2022 Amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code</strong> and the groundbreaking <strong>UCC Article 12</strong>. This legislative instrument introduced the first comprehensive legal framework in the United States for commercial transactions involving digital assets, establishing rules for controllable electronic records (CERs) that govern how cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other blockchain-based data objects can be bought, sold, and used as collateral.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work on UCC Article 12 represents a fundamental evolution in American personal property law and commercial law. Andrea Tosato helped craft the legal concept of "control" (12-105) as applied to digital assets, drawing parallels to possession in tangible property while adapting these principles for the unique characteristics of blockchain technology. Moreover, he was also closely involved in developing the "qualified purchaser" rule in 12Through UCC Article 12, the law now provides clear rules for determining who has superior rights when multiple parties claim interests in the same digital asset, a critical issue for the development of secured lending using cryptocurrency and other digital assets as collateral.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, Andrea Tosato serves as Associate Research Director of the <strong>Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code</strong>, where he works  to support the interpretation and the development of the UCC. He is also a member of the ULC Enactment Committee for the 2022 UCC Amendments, actively working on the enactment of UCC Article 12 and related provisions across the United States. 
      </p>

      <h2>International Law Reform on Digital Assets</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond his work on UCC Article 12, Professor Tosato has made significant contributions to international law reform concerning digital assets. He was a member of the Drafting Committee for the <strong>UNIDROIT Working Group on Digital Assets and Private Law</strong>, which produced the UNIDROIT Principles on Digital Assets and Private Law in 2023. This international instrument provides cardinal principles to help jurisdictions worldwide develop their private law framework for transactions involving digital assets, addressing issues of ownership, transfer, use as collateral and custody.
      </p>

      <p>
        Andrea Tosato also advises governments and international organizations on digital assets policy. In the United Kingdom, he has advised the Law Commission of England and Wales on its secured transactions and digital assets initiatives. Internationally, he regularly serves as an expert advisor to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT).
      </p>

      <h2>Verified Carbon Credits and Environmental Markets</h2>

      <p>
        More recently, Andrea Tosato has expanded his research to explore the private law dimensions of verified carbon credits. He is currently a member of the drafting committee for the <strong>UNIDROIT Working Group on the Legal Nature of Verified Carbon Credits</strong> and serves as co-reporter for the Uniform Law Commission <strong>Commercial Law Framework for Voluntary Carbon Credits Committee</strong>. This work presents similar challenges as those previously encountered when helping to craft the private lar framework for digital assets. The tokenization of verified carbon credits is an area of particular interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professor Tosato has published extensively on commercial law, digital assets, secured transactions, and bankruptcy.

His work has been cited by international bodies including the World Bank and the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice, demonstrating the impact of his scholarship on legal systems worldwide.
      </p>
