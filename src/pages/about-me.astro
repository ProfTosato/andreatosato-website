      <p>
        I am a Law Professor at the SMU Dedman School of Law, where my research focuses on the intersection between private law, emerging technologies, and intangible assets. My scholarship focuses particularly on commercial law, secured transactions, and bankruptcy law as they intersect with cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs, and verified carbon credits.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a key contributor to the ULC/ALI Uniform Commercial Code and Emerging Technologies Committee that drafted the <strong>2022 Amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code</strong> and <strong>Article 12</strong>. At present, I am a member of the ULC Committee working on the enactment of these new laws across the United States. I was also a member of the Drafting Committee that prepared the <strong>UNIDROIT Working Group on Digital Assets and Private Law</strong> and continued to be involved in the adoption of this international soft-law instrument.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, my research has expanded to explore the private law dimensions of verified carbon credits. I am currently a member of the drafting committee for the <strong>UNIDROIT Working Group on the Legal Nature of Verified Carbon Credits</strong> and the co-reporter for the Uniform Law Commission <strong>Commercial Law Framework for Voluntary Carbon Credits Committee</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My scholarship has been published in leading law journals, including the <em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review, North Carolina Law Review, Alabama Law Review, Arizona State Law Journal, Florida Law Review, Fordham Law Review, Hastings Law Journal, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, European Law Journal, Lloyd's Maritime and Commercial Law Quarterly,</em> and <em>Law & Contemporary Problems</em>. My recent paper, <strong>The Private Law of Stablecoins</strong> (with Professors Kara Bruce and Christopher Odinet), was awarded the <strong>Grant Gilmore Award</strong> of the American College of Commercial Finance Lawyers in recognition of "superior writing in the field of commercial finance law".
