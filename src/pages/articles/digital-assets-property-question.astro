  abstract="What does it mean to own a digital asset? This fundamental question lies at the heart of ongoing debates about the legal status of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, and other blockchain-based assets. This Article tackles the property question head-on, examining whether and how digital assets fit within traditional property law frameworks. We argue that digital assets possess sufficient characteristics to be recognized as property, but their unique features require adaptation of existing legal doctrines. The Article analyzes competing approaches to digital asset ownership, including the possession-based model and the rights-based model. We examine how property characterization affects critical legal issues including secured transactions, bankruptcy, and remedies for theft or conversion. Drawing on comparative law insights and examining recent legislative developments, we propose a coherent framework for understanding digital assets as a new category of property that respects both their technological distinctiveness and the need for legal certainty in digital markets."
