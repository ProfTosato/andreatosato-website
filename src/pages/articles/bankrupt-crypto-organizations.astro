  abstract="The spectacular collapses of major cryptocurrency organizations have revealed fundamental gaps in how bankruptcy law addresses digital asset insolvencies. This Article examines the unique challenges that arise when crypto organizations enter bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike traditional financial institutions, crypto organizations hold digital assets that do not fit neatly into existing bankruptcy categories, operate on decentralized networks that complicate asset recovery, and often have complex international structures that blur jurisdictional lines. We analyze the recent bankruptcies of major crypto exchanges and lending platforms to identify recurring legal issues, including the classification of digital assets under the Bankruptcy Code, the treatment of customer deposits, and the application of automatic stay provisions to blockchain transactions. The Article reveals how current bankruptcy law is ill-equipped to handle crypto insolvencies and proposes reforms to protect customers and creditors while preserving the legitimate innovation in digital asset markets. We address critical questions about whether crypto customers are creditors or bailors, how to value volatile digital assets in bankruptcy proceedings, and what priority rules should apply to competing claims on crypto assets."
