  abstract="This Article explores debt tokens, a novel form of debt instrument that exists on blockchain networks. Debt tokens represent a fundamental shift in how debt obligations can be created, transferred, and enforced in digital environments. We analyze the legal implications of tokenizing debt, including questions of property characterization, transferability, and the intersection with existing securities regulations. The Article examines how debt tokens challenge traditional concepts of negotiability and the holder-in-due-course doctrine. We also address the regulatory frameworks that apply to debt tokens under federal securities law and the Uniform Commercial Code. Finally, we propose a framework for understanding debt tokens that acknowledges both their innovative features and the need for legal clarity to facilitate their responsible development and use in modern financial markets."
