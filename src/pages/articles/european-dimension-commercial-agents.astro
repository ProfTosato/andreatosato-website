  abstract="The regulation of commercial agency relationships represents one of the European Union's early efforts at harmonizing private law. The Commercial Agents Directive, adopted in 1986, sought to create a level playing field across member states by establishing minimum standards for the relationship between commercial agents and their principals. This Article provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Directive has shaped the development of commercial agency law across Europe and examines the extent to which true harmonization has been achieved. Through detailed examination of the Directive's implementation in different member states, the Article reveals significant divergences in how national legal systems have transposed and applied EU requirements. These differences arise both from variations in implementing legislation and from divergent judicial interpretations of key concepts. The Article identifies several areas where harmonization remains incomplete, including: the scope of application of the agent regulations, the calculation of compensation and indemnity upon termination, the interpretation of good faith obligations, and remedies for breach. The analysis demonstrates that member states with different legal traditions—particularly common law versus civil law jurisdictions—have approached the Directive's requirements in fundamentally different ways. The Article also examines the European Court of Justice's role in promoting uniform interpretation and assesses the effectiveness of the preliminary reference procedure in resolving ambiguities. It reveals that relatively few cases have reached the ECJ, leaving many important questions unresolved. The Article concludes by evaluating whether the current state of harmonization serves the Directive's original objectives of facilitating cross-border commerce and protecting commercial agents. It proposes reforms that could enhance uniformity while respecting legitimate national differences in commercial practice and legal tradition."
